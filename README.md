# Medical Insurance Charges Prediction

## Research Problem:  
**Predicting Medical Insurance Charges Based on Demographic and Health Factors**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that predicts an individualâ€™s medical insurance charges based on demographic and health-related factors, including age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and residential region. This helps insurance companies and consumers make informed decisions while improving the accuracy of insurance pricing and potentially offering personalized insurance plans.

### Dataset
-**Kaggle link**: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mariapushkareva/medical-insurance-cost-with-linear-regression/input
 
### Features of the dataset  and Their Importance:
- **age**: Represents the beneficiary's age. Typically, older individuals incur higher medical costs.
- **sex**: Gender of the policyholder (male/female), which may influence insurance charges due to varying health risks.
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index, an indicator of body weight. Higher BMI suggests higher health risks.
- **children**: Number of dependents covered under the insurance plan. More dependents usually increase the insurance costs.
- **smoker**: Whether the person is a smoker. Smokers incur higher costs due to significant health risks.
- **region**: Residential area (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest) as healthcare costs vary regionally.
